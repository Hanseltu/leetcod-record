## [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/description/)

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of intergers with the first five terms as following:

```
1. 1

2. 11

3. 21

4.1211

5.111221
```

`1` is read off as **"one 1"** or `11`.

`11` is read off as **"two 1s"** or `21`.

`21` is read off as **"one 2,the one 1"** or `1211`.

Given an interger n,genenrate the $n^th$ term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note:Each term of the sequence of intergers will be represented as a string.
